Citations DataModel:
Second question I have is about how to save the Citations data into the database. An article/submission will have one or more citations. I was wondering which is best:
* save the citations line by line (one row for every citation)
* as a json blob
* as a serialized array (php serialize)
* other method I am not aware of
